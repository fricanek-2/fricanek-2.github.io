        <h2>What is Options Trading?</h2>
        <p>
            Options trading involves buying and selling contracts that give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date. Options are a type of derivative, meaning their value is derived from the price of an underlying asset such as stocks, commodities, or indices.

    <section id="types-of-options">
        <h2>Types of Options</h2>
        <h3>1. Call Options</h3>
        <p>
            A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price (known as the strike price) before the option expires. Traders use call options when they expect the price of the asset to rise.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Put Options</h3>
        <p>
            A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price before the expiration date. Traders use put options when they expect the price of the asset to fall.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Trading Strategies</h2>
        <h3>1. Buying Calls</h3>
        <p>
            A bullish strategy where traders purchase call options expecting the underlying asset's price to rise above the strike price.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Buying Puts</h3>
        <p>
            A bearish strategy where traders purchase put options expecting the underlying asset's price to fall below the strike price.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Covered Calls</h3>
        <p>
            A conservative strategy where traders hold the underlying asset and sell call options to generate income.

    <section id="risks-and-rewards">
        <h2>Risks and Rewards of Options Trading</h2>
        <p>
            Options trading can offer significant rewards due to leverage, allowing traders to control a large position with a small investment. However, it is also risky, as options can expire worthless, resulting in a total loss of the premium paid. It's important to understand the risks and have a well-thought-out strategy.
